# Java Data Structures Learning Project

This repository is dedicated to my journey learning data structures in Java. It serves as a practical workspace where I explore and implement various data structures and associated algorithms.

## Data Structures Covered

- [X] Arrays
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Hash Tables

## Algorithms Covered

### Arrays
- [X] [MaxMinFinder (Linear Search)](src/main/java/dev/gaetanobarreca/arrays/searching/MaxMinFinder.java)

More algorithms will be added as my journey progresses.
